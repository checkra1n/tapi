Abstract
========

SDKDB is a database containing all the interfaces from a SDK, both public
and private. The primary usage of SDKDB is API/SPI checking for 3rd party
apps in the AppStore. It can also be used to perform SDK API regression
checking, availability info verification, etc.

Currently, SDKDB contains information about:

- Symbols: exported symbols from the dynamic libraries. They are interfaces
  that can be linked and called from other binaries. They are mostly coming from
  C function interfaces or globals.

- Objective-C Classes: information of Objective-C classes, including its
  name, super class, all methods and conformed protocols.

- Objective-C Category: information of Objective-C category, including its
  name, base class, all methods and conformed protocols.

- Objective-C Protocol: information of Objective-C protocol, including its
  name, all methods and conformed protocols.


.. _sdkdb_format:

Format
======

Currently, SDKDB is in JSON format. It can be easily process by any JSON
parser. SDKDB is a JSON object on the top level. It is a map from
:ref:`target <sdkdb_target>` to an array of :ref:`APIs <sdkdb_api>` where each of them
represents all the exported interfaces from a binary. There are few variants
of SDKDB format and all of them are heavily dependent on :ref:`API <sdkdb_api>`
data structure.

Please refer to :ref:`JSON Data Structure <sdkdb_json>` for detailed information
about all information available in the SDKDB and how to interpret them.
Please note that all the fields with empty array, empty string, default enum
value or false are omitted from SDKDB to save space.

.. _sdkdb_SDKDB:

SDKDB
-----

Here is a simple example of SDKDB:

.. code-block:: python

 {
   "arm64-apple-ios12": [
     {
       "binaryInfo": {
         "compatibilityVersion": "1",
         "currentVersion": "1",
         "installName": "/usr/lib/libtest.1.dylib",
         "reexportedLibraries": [
           "/usr/lib/libfoo.dylib"
         ],
         "twoLevelNamespace": true,
         "type": "dylib"
       },
       "globals": [
         {
           "access": "public",
           "file": "test.h",
           "linkage": "exported",
           "name": "_bar"
         }
       ],
       "interfaces": [
         {
           "access": "public",
           "classMethods": [
             {
               "name": "new"
             }
           ],
           "file": "test.h",
           "instanceMethods": [
             {
               "name": "foo:"
             },
             {
               "access": "public",
               "introduced": "9.0",
               "name": "init"
             }
           ],
           "linkage": "exported",
           "name": "Foo",
           "super": "NSObject"
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
 }

There is also a public-only variation of SDKDB which only stores APIs that are
public. In this case, :ref:`access <sdkdb_access>` field is omitted because all of
them are public. To distinguish from the normal SDKDB, it also has a boolean
field to indicate it is public. The public only SDKDB for the dylib above looks
like:

.. code-block:: python

 {
   "arm64-apple-ios12": [
     {
       "binaryInfo": {
         "compatibilityVersion": "1",
         "currentVersion": "1",
         "installName": "/usr/lib/libtest.1.dylib",
         "reexportedLibraries": [
           "/usr/lib/libfoo.dylib"
         ],
         "twoLevelNamespace": true,
         "type": "dylib"
       },
       "globals": [
         {
           "file": "test.h",
           "linkage": "exported",
           "name": "_bar"
         }
       ],
       "interfaces": [
         {
           "file": "test.h",
           "instanceMethods": [
             {
               "introduced": "9.0",
               "name": "init"
             }
           ],
           "linkage": "exported",
           "name": "Foo",
           "super": "NSObject"
         }
       ]
     }
   ],
   "public": true
 }

.. _sdkdb_partialSDKDB:

Partial SDKDB
-------------

Partial SDKDBs are the intermediate representation for SDK information before
assembling into full SDKDB. It contains information of RuntimeRoot,
SDKContentRoot and PublicSDKContentRoot seperately, and each of them is
represented by an array of :ref:`APIs <sdkdb_api>`. There is also a version
key to represent the partial SDKDB version. The current supported version
is "1.0". If the interface scanning failed in anyway during partial SDKDB
generation, "error" bit will be set. "projectName" corresponding to
"RC_ProjectName" XBS environment when partial SDKDB is generated.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: python

  {
     "PublicSDKContentRoot": [],
     "RuntimeRoot": [
       {
          "//": "SomeAPI"
       }
     ],
     "SDKContentRoot" : [
       {
          "//": "SomeAPI"
       }
     ],
     "error": true,
     "projectName": "MyProject",
     "version": "1.0"
  }

is declared in the SDK.

- file: The source file/header
